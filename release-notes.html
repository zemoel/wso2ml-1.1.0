        <h1>WSO2 Machine Learner 1.1.0 Release Notes</h1>

        <p>The WSO2 Machine Learner team is pleased to announce the 1.1.0
            release of the WSO2 Machine Learner.

            The WSO2 Machine Learner provides a user friendly wizard like interface, which guides users through
            a set of steps to find and configure machine learning algorithms. The outcome of this process is a
            model that can be deployed in multiple WSO2 products, such as WSO2 Enterprise Service Bus (ESB),
            WSO2 Complex Event Processor (CEP), etc.
            This is based on the revolutionary WSO2 Carbon framework.
            All the major features have been developed as pluggable Carbon components.
        </p>

        We are striving for a simple and happy first time user experience as well as a
        satisfying experienced user experience with this release.
